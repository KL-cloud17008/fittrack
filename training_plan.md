# 5-Day Gym Training Plan — Returning Trainee at 325 lbs

## Phase 1: Foundation Re-Build (Weeks 1–8)

---

## 1. Assumptions and Safety Notes

**Assumptions based on your answers:**

- **Goals (priority order):** Fat loss, general fitness, mobility/pain-free movement, posture improvement
- **Training time:** 1–3 AM — body will be significantly stiffer than daytime training, especially hips, ankles, and thoracic spine. The pre-workout mobility routine is non-negotiable; it does double duty as both prep work and counteracting nighttime stiffness.
- **Seated 16 hours/day:** This is the primary driver of your posture issues. Anterior pelvic tilt, rounded shoulders, and forward head are textbook prolonged-sitting adaptations. The "undo sitting" micro-routine throughout the day matters as much as gym work for long-term posture change.
- **Plantar fasciitis history:** At 325 lbs with 8,000–9,000 daily walking steps, your feet carry serious mechanical load. Every pre-workout session includes dedicated foot/ankle work with clear "back off" triggers if symptoms flare.
- **Experience level:** 4 years of training history (ages 15–19), 2 months detrained. You know how to use machines and push yourself. Programming reflects a returning trainee, not a fragile beginner.
- **Gym session target:** 45 minutes of main work (not counting walks).
- **Caloric deficit:** ~2,874 kcal with 305 g protein. Protein is excellent for muscle retention. Recovery monitoring is important — see Section 14.

**Safety rules that never change:**

- If sharp or sudden pain occurs in any joint: stop that exercise immediately. Dull muscular burn and fatigue are expected and welcomed.
- If plantar fascia pain exceeds 4/10 during walks: shorten stride length, slow pace, and apply the foot substitutions in Section 4.
- If any exercise causes knee tracking issues (knee caving or shifting): reduce range of motion or switch to the listed substitution before reducing load.
- Tempo prescriptions are not optional — they are a primary difficulty lever and joint-protection tool. Slow eccentrics reduce peak joint forces while increasing time under tension.

## 2. Recommended Plan Duration and Progression Criteria

**Recommended duration: 8 weeks (2 mesocycles of 4 weeks each)**

**Reasoning:**

- Weeks 1–4 (Mesocycle 1): Re-establish movement patterns under load, let connective tissue begin adapting to regular machine-based training, build work capacity and session density. This is real training, not an intro phase — but tendons and ligaments adapt slower than muscles. Four weeks gives joints time to catch up.
- Weeks 5–8 (Mesocycle 2): Increase loads, reduce rest periods, add complexity (smith machine variations, heavier top sets, longer AMRAP finishers). By Week 5 your joints and connective tissue have 4 weeks of consistent loading behind them.

**Deload: Week 4 and Week 8** — reduce volume by 40%, keep loads the same, cut all AMRAP finishers. This is active recovery, not a week off.

**Criteria to progress to Phase 2 (a more advanced program):**

| Marker | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Leg press (quad-focused) | 3×10 at 270+ lbs with controlled 3-1-1 tempo |
| Cable row | 3×12 at 100+ lbs with 2-sec pause at contraction |
| Machine chest press | 3×10 at 120+ lbs with 3-1-1 tempo |
| Bodyweight | Trending downward (even 5–10 lbs in 8 weeks is meaningful) |
| Session completion | Finishing all prescribed sets/reps at RPE 7–8 consistently |
| Plantar fascia | Walking 8,000+ steps daily without exceeding 3/10 pain |
| Movement quality | All exercises through full prescribed ROM with good control |

**What Phase 2 generally looks like:**

- Introduction of smith machine split squats and heel-elevated squats
- Walking lunges as a progression option
- Heavier loading on all compound movements (top sets at RPE 8–9)
- Possible shift to Push/Pull/Legs/Upper/Lower split
- Addition of goblet squats if mobility supports it
- Greater exercise variation and reduced machine dependency

## 3. Weekly Schedule Overview

**Split: Upper A / Lower A / Upper B / Lower B / Full-Body Pump**

Each muscle group gets two meaningful exposures per week with different exercise emphasis. Day 5 is a higher-rep metabolic session for work capacity and calorie burn.

| Day | Focus | Gym Time | Total Daily Time |
|-----|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Day 1 (Mon) | Upper A — Horizontal Push/Pull | ~45 min | ~2 hrs |
| Day 2 (Tue) | Lower A — Quad and Calf Focus | ~45 min | ~2 hrs |
| Day 3 (Wed) | Upper B — Vertical Push/Pull | ~45 min | ~2 hrs |
| Day 4 (Thu) | Lower B — Posterior Chain/Hip | ~45 min | ~2 hrs |
| Day 5 (Fri) | Full-Body Pump — High-Rep Metabolic | ~45 min | ~2 hrs |
| Day 6 (Sat) | OFF — Undo-sitting micro-routine only | — | 5–15 min |
| Day 7 (Sun) | OFF — Undo-sitting micro-routine only | — | 5–15 min |

Total daily time breakdown: Home mobility (10 min) + walk to gym (30 min) + gym (45 min) + walk home (30 min) + cooldown (7 min) ≈ 2 hours.

## 4. Mandatory Daily Pre-Workout Mobility Routine (AT HOME)

Performed at home before walking to the gym. Duration: 8–12 minutes. No equipment — bodyweight, wall, and floor only.

### Structure (every day)

The routine has 3 fixed blocks + 1 rotating block:

- **Block 1:** Feet and Ankles (2.5 min)
- **Block 2:** Shin and Foot Strength (2 min)
- **Block 3:** Anti-Sitting Posture Reset (3 min)
- **Block 4:** Day-Specific Prep (2–3 min)

---

### VERSION A — Normal Day (10–12 min)

**Block 1: Feet and Ankles (2.5 min)**

| # | Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|---|----------|------|------|
| 1 | Toe Spreads and Scrunches | 15 reps each | Sit on floor. Spread all 5 toes apart wide, hold 1 sec, then curl them under and grip the floor hard. Deliberate reps. |
| 2 | Standing Wall Ankle Dorsiflexion | 10 slow reps per side | Face wall, foot ~4 in from wall. Drive knee over toes toward wall, heel glued to floor. If knee touches easily, move foot back 1 inch. |
| 3 | Standing Calf Stretch (wall) | 30-sec hold per side | Back leg straight, heel pressed to floor, lean into wall until calf stretch. Breathe through it. |

**Block 2: Shin and Foot Strength (2 min)**

| # | Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|---|----------|------|------|
| 4 | Wall Tibialis Raise | 2 × 15 reps (30 sec rest) | Back and glutes against wall, feet ~12 in from wall. Pull toes up hard, hold top 1 sec, 2 sec down. Shins should burn by rep 12. If not, move feet further out. |
| 5 | Single-Leg Balance | 30 sec per side | Barefoot. Grip floor with toes. Close eyes last 10 sec if easy. Builds intrinsic foot strength under full bodyweight. |

**Block 3: Anti-Sitting Posture Reset (3 min)**

| # | Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|---|----------|------|------|
| 6 | Half-Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch | 45 sec per side | Kneel on one knee (pillow under knee if needed). Tuck tailbone under — "belt buckle to chin." Squeeze glute on kneeling side. Do NOT arch low back. |
| 7 | Supine Figure-4 Hip Rotation | 10 slow reps per side | Lie on back, knees bent. Cross ankle over opposite knee. Let crossed knee fall open, then pull it back. 2 sec each direction. Addresses hip internal rotation and adductor stiffness. |
| 8 | Floor Thoracic Extension Reach | 8 reps | Face-up, knees bent. Reach both arms overhead toward floor behind you. Each rep reach further, exhale fully. Hold final rep 5 sec. |
| 9 | Wall Chin Tuck | 10 reps, 3-sec hold | Back of head touching wall. Draw chin straight back ("double chin") without tilting. Hold 3 sec. Feel deep neck flexors engage. |

**Block 4: Day-Specific Prep (2–3 min)**

| Training Day | Prep Focus | Exercises |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Day 1 (Upper A) | Shoulder/scapular | **Wall Slides:** 10 reps, back to wall, arms in goalpost sliding up/down. Then **Wall Push-Up Plus:** 10 reps, at top push extra far (protract shoulders), hold 2 sec. |
| Day 2 (Lower A) | Extra hip/ankle | **Assisted Wall Squat:** 10 slow reps (3s down, 1s pause), hands on wall for balance. Then **Standing Adductor Stretch:** 30 sec per side, wide stance, shift weight side to side. |
| Day 3 (Upper B) | Shoulder overhead | **Floor Snow Angels:** 10 slow reps, face-up, arms sweep along floor in arc. Then **Prone Y-Raise:** 8 reps, face-down, thumbs up, lift 2 inches, hold 3 sec. Lower trap activation. |
| Day 4 (Lower B) | Glute activation/hinge | **Glute Bridge Iso-Hold:** 2 × 30 sec, squeeze glutes hard. 15 sec rest between. Then **Standing Hip Hinge:** 8 slow reps, hands on hips, push hips back, flat back. |
| Day 5 (Full-Body) | General flow | **World's Greatest Stretch (modified):** 5 per side from half-kneeling, rotate top arm to ceiling, hold 3 sec. Then **Glute Bridge:** 15 reps, 1-sec squeeze at top. |

---

### VERSION B — Sore or Stiff Day (8–9 min)

Use when notably stiff, sore from previous training, or joints feel achy.

**Block 1: Feet and Ankles (2 min)**

| # | Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|---|----------|------|------|
| 1 | Gentle Toe Wiggles and Ankle Circles | 30 sec | Wiggle toes freely, then slow circles with each ankle — 10 per direction. |
| 2 | Seated Ankle Dorsiflexion | 8 reps per side | Sit, one leg extended. Pull toes toward shin gently, hold 2 sec. No forcing. |
| 3 | Standing Calf Stretch | 20-sec hold per side | Same as Version A, shorter hold, gentler lean. |

**Block 2: Shin and Foot Strength (1.5 min)**

| # | Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|---|----------|------|------|
| 4 | Wall Tibialis Raise | 1 × 12 (slow) | Same position, 1 set only, slower pace. |
| 5 | Two-Leg Balance with Toe Grips | 30 sec | Both feet, grip floor with toes. No single-leg on stiff days. |

**Block 3: Anti-Sitting Posture Reset (3 min)**

| # | Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|---|----------|------|------|
| 6 | Hip Flexor Stretch (gentle) | 30 sec per side | Same position, less aggressive tilt. Focus on breathing. |
| 7 | Supine Knee Drops | 10 reps total | Knees bent, feet wider than hips, drop both knees side to side. No forcing. |
| 8 | Supine Arm Circles | 10 per direction | Face-up, arms to ceiling, slow circles. Opens thoracic area gently. |
| 9 | Supine Chin Tuck | 8 reps, 2-sec hold | Lying down — less demand on fatigued neck muscles. |

**Block 4:** Same exercises as Version A but 6 reps each, smaller ROM. Skip anything over 3/10 discomfort.

---

### Weekly Progression for Mobility

| Weeks | Progression |
|-------|-------------|
| 1–2 | Perform as written. Learn positions. |
| 3–4 | +5 sec on all holds. +2 reps on rep-based moves. Move foot back 0.5 in on wall dorsiflexion if easy. |
| 5–6 | 3 × 15 wall tibialis raises. Hip flexor stretch to 60 sec/side. Add 5-sec iso-hold at end range of figure-4s. |
| 7–8 | Single-leg balance: eyes closed full 30 sec. Max comfortable range on all stretches. Chin tucks: 5-sec holds. |

---

### Substitutions for Pain/Discomfort

| Symptom | Swap Out | Swap In |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Plantar fascia pain | Toe scrunches | Gentle toe lifts only (lift toes, hold 3 sec, lower). Roll foot on frozen water bottle before routine if available. |
| Shin splint symptoms | Wall tibialis raises | Seated toe taps — 30 sec gentle tapping. Reduce walk pace. |
| Ankle pinching | Wall ankle dorsiflexion | Seated ankle circles in pain-free range, 15/direction/side. |
| Knee pain | Wall squat, single-leg balance | Comfortable-angle wall sit (above 90°) for 20 sec, or supine leg raises. |
| Hip pinching (front) | Figure-4 rotations, deep hip flexor stretch | Reduce range. Replace figure-4 with supine knee drops. Standing quad stretch instead of hip flexor if it pinches. |
| Shoulder impingement | Wall slides, snow angels, Y-raises | Wall scapular squeezes — hands on wall at chest height, squeeze blades, 3-sec hold × 10. Keep arms below shoulder height. |

---

## 5. Daily Post-Workout Cooldown (AT HOME)

After walk home. Duration: 5–8 minutes. Bodyweight + wall + floor only. Purpose: static stretching of trained muscles and parasympathetic down-regulation (critical for sleep given 1–3 AM training).

### Universal Closer (every day, 2 min)

| # | Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|---|----------|------|------|
| 1 | 90/90 Breathing | 5 breaths (4s in, 7s out) | Lie on back, legs up on wall/couch at ~90° hip and knee. Hands on belly. Breathe into belly, exhale slowly through pursed lips. Down-regulates nervous system. |
| 2 | Supine Full-Body Stretch | 30 sec | Arms overhead on floor, legs straight up wall. Reach long. Breathe. |

### Day-Specific Stretching (3–5 min)

**Day 1 — Upper A:**

| Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|----------|------|------|
| Doorway/Wall Corner Chest Stretch | 30 sec/side | Arm at 90° on wall, step forward until chest stretch. |
| Cross-Body Shoulder Stretch | 30 sec/side | Pull arm across body. Stretch posterior shoulder. |
| Seated Lat Side Bend | 30 sec/side | Sit, reach one arm overhead, lean away. |

**Day 2 — Lower A:**

| Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|----------|------|------|
| Standing Quad Stretch | 45 sec/side | Near wall for balance. Grab foot behind, tuck pelvis. |
| Standing Calf Stretch | 30 sec/side straight knee + 30 sec/side bent knee | Straight = gastrocnemius. Bent = soleus/Achilles. |
| Supine Knee-to-Chest | 30 sec/side | Pull one knee to chest. Stretch low back and glute. |

**Day 3 — Upper B:**

| Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|----------|------|------|
| Wall Lat Stretch | 30 sec/side | Hands high on wall, step back, chest sinks. |
| Supine Pec Stretch | 30 sec/side | Face-up, arm out at 90° palm up. Let gravity open chest. |
| Neck Side Bend Stretch | 20 sec/side | Ear toward shoulder, gentle hand weight (don't pull). |

**Day 4 — Lower B:**

| Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|----------|------|------|
| Supine Hamstring Stretch (leg up wall) | 45 sec/side | One leg up wall, scoot closer to increase stretch. |
| Supine Figure-4 Glute Stretch | 30 sec/side | Ankle over opposite knee, let gravity open hip. |
| Half-Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch | 30 sec/side | Gentle. Cooling down, not warming up. Focus on breathing. |

**Day 5 — Full-Body:**

| Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|----------|------|------|
| Child's Pose (wide knee) | 45 sec | Knees wide, arms forward, hips back. Relax. |
| Supine Spinal Twist | 30 sec/side | Cross knee over body, arms out. Gravity does the work. |
| Standing Forward Fold | 30 sec | Feet hip-width, bend forward, arms hang, knees bent as needed. |

---

## 6. Daily "Undo Sitting" Micro-Routine (2–5 min, at home)

**When:** 1–3 times per day during/after sitting bouts. Aim for every 3–4 hours. At 16 hrs seated, aim for at least 3 sessions.

### The Routine (3 min)

| # | Exercise | Dose | Cues |
|---|----------|------|------|
| 1 | Standing Hip Extension | 10 per side | Hold wall, kick leg straight back, squeeze glute 2 sec. Reverses hip flexor shortening. |
| 2 | Standing Pelvic Tilt | 10 reps, 3-sec hold | Tuck tailbone under ("belt buckle to chin"), hold, release. Most important drill for your APT. |
| 3 | Wall Chest Opener | 20 sec | Arms on wall at 90°, lean forward. Open chest. Breathe. |
| 4 | Chin Tuck | 8 reps, 3-sec hold | Draw chin straight back. Done 3×/day, this can meaningfully improve forward head posture over weeks. |
| 5 | Standing Thoracic Rotation | 6 per side | Arms crossed over chest. Rotate upper body L/R. Hips stay forward. |

**Quick Posture Check (10 sec):** After routine, stand tall — ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips, pelvis neutral, weight balanced. Hold 10 sec. Memorize this position.

### Progression

| Weeks | Change |
|-------|--------|
| 1–2 | As written. |
| 3–4 | +5 reps on hip extensions and pelvic tilts. +10 sec on chest opener. |
| 5–6 | Add 15-sec wall sit at end. |
| 7–8 | 5-sec chin tuck holds. Add 5 slow wall slides after chest opener. Routine is now ~4–5 min. |

|---|----------|-------------|-------|------|-----|----------------|
| A1 | Lat Pulldown (wide grip) | 1×8 (top), 2×10 (back-off) | 3-1-1 | 90 sec | Top: 8, Back-offs: 7 | Thigh pad snug. Grip wide (just outside shoulders). Pull to upper chest, elbows down and back, 1-sec lat squeeze. Slight lean (10–15°) fine. No momentum. Never behind neck. |
| A2 | Machine Shoulder Press | 1×8 (top), 2×10 (back-off) | 3-1-1 | 90 sec | Top: 8, Back-offs: 7 | Handles start at ~ear height. Feet flat. Press to just short of lockout. Back against pad. **If overhead causes pain:** sub cable lateral raise. |
| B1 | Close-Grip Lat Pulldown (V-bar) | 3 × 12 | 2-1-1 | 60 sec | 7 | V-bar or close-grip handle. Chest up, elbows to ribcage, squeeze. Different angle than wide grip — more lower lat. *Superset with B2.* |
| B2 | Dumbbell Lateral Raise | 3 × 12 | 2-1-2 | 60 sec | 7 | Stand or sit. Raise to shoulder height (not higher), lead with elbows, slight forward lean. 1-sec hold at top. 2-sec negative is where medial delt works hardest. *Superset with B1.* |

### Gym Warm-Up (3 min)
- Seated leg curl: 1 × 12 at lightest
- Seated leg curl: 1 × 8 at ~50% working weight

### Main Work (~45 min — 17 working sets)

| # | Exercise | Sets × Reps | Tempo | Rest | RPE | Setup and Cues |
|---|----------|-------------|-------|------|-----|----------------|
| A1 | Seated Leg Curl | 1×8 (top), 2×10 (back-off) | 3-1-1 | 90 sec | Top: 8, Back-offs: 7 | Knee aligns with machine pivot. Ankle pad above heel. Curl heels toward glutes, 1-sec squeeze at full contraction, 3-sec resist on return. Extend to just short of full lockout — don't hyperextend knees. |

Hinge at hips (hips back, soft knees), then drive forward by squeezing glutes. 1-sec lockout hold. Chest up, spine neutral. **Safest hip hinge for your size** — cable provides consistent tension, movement is self-limiting. |
| B1 | Lying Leg Curl | 3 × 10 | 3-1-1 | 60 sec | 7 | Face-down, ankle pad above heels. Hips stay pressed to pad. Different angle than seated — different hamstring emphasis. *Superset with B2.* |
| B2 | Hip Abduction Machine | 3 × 15 | 2-1-1 | 45 sec | 7 | Back against pad. Press knees apart, 1-sec hold at full spread, slow return. Glute medius — critical for hip stability and pelvic control. Adjust pads so start position is comfortable. *Superset with B1.* |
| C1 | Leg Press (narrow, feet low — ham/glute bias) | 3 × 10 | 3-1-1 | 90 sec | 7–8 | Feet hip-width or narrower, LOW on platform (heels near bottom). Biases glutes/hamstrings through deeper hip flexion. Same depth rule — back stays on pad. |
| C2 | Seated Calf Raise | 2 × 15 | 2-2-1 | 60 sec | 7 | Full ROM, 2-sec squeeze at top. Same as Day 2. |

**Finisher — Glute Burner Circuit (4 min):**

## 11. Day 5 — Full-Body Pump: High-Rep Metabolic

Lighter loads, higher reps, shorter rest, superset pairings. Stimulus = work capacity, blood flow, volume accumulation, calorie burn. Not a heavy day.

**Home:** Mobility Blocks 1–3 + Day 5 Prep (world's greatest stretch, glute bridges)
**Walk to gym:** ~30 min

### Gym Warm-Up (2 min)
- 1 × 12 of first exercise at light weight

### Main Work (~45 min — 18 working sets)

Keep heart rate moderately elevated. Minimal transition between pairs.

## 12. Progression Plan (Weeks 1–8)

### Weekly Overload Strategy

| Week | Load | Volume | Tempo | Rest | Finishers |
|------|------|--------|-------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Establish working weights. All top sets RPE 8, back-offs RPE 7. | As written (14–18 sets/session) | As written | As written | As written |
| 2 | If RPE was below target, add 5–10 lbs machines, 2.5–5 lbs DBs | Same | Same | Same | Beat Week 1 scores |
| 3 | +5–10 lbs compounds. Isolations same weight +1 rep/set. +1 set on one compound per session. | +1 set one compound/session | +1 sec eccentric on 1 exercise/session | −10 sec on superset rest | +1 min on AMRAP finishers |
| **4 (DELOAD)** | Same as Week 3 | −40% (10–11 sets/session). Top sets only, drop back-offs. | Original | Original | No finishers |
| 5 | +5–10 lbs over Week 3 compounds. +5 lbs isolations. | Return to full written volume | Original | Original | Finishers return |
| 6 | +5 lbs compounds. Day 5 reps +2 (15→17, 12→14). | +1 set one isolation/session | 2-sec pause at peak on 2 exercises/session | −10 sec on compound back-off rest | Beat Week 5 scores |
| 7 | +5 lbs compounds. Hold isolation loads, +1 sec eccentric on all. | Peak volume (+1 more set one exercise/session) | Slowest tempos of program | Tightest rest | 5–6 min finishers |
| **8 (DELOAD)** | Same as Week 7 | −40% | Original | Original | No finishers |

## 13. Joint-Friendly Modifications (by Symptom)

### Knee Pain

| Exercise | Modification |
|----------|--------------|
| Leg press | Stop at 100° knee bend. Elevate heels on small plate if needed. |
| Leg extension | Limit eccentric to 90° bend. Lighter weight, slower tempo. If painful at all angles, replace with cable terminal knee extension. |
| Standing calf raise | Switch to seated (less knee compression). |

### Low Back Pain

| Exercise | Modification |
|----------|--------------|
| Leg press | Back FLAT on pad. Reduce depth immediately if back rounds. |
| Cable pull-through | Reduce load. If back takes over, weight is too heavy. Replace with hip abduction if still painful. |
| Seated cable row | Sit on slightly elevated pad for neutral spine. Reduce ROM. |

### Hip Pain (Front/Groin)

| Exercise | Modification |
|----------|--------------|
| Leg press (deep) | Reduce depth. Widen stance, angle toes out more. |
| Hip adduction machine | Reduce starting width. |
| Cable pull-through | Shallower hip hinge. |

### Shoulder Pain

| Exercise | Modification |
|----------|--------------|
| Machine chest press | Don't let handles past plane of chest. Sub cable chest press for freer path. |
| Machine shoulder press | Replace with cable lateral raise + cable front raise. |
| Lat pulldown | Switch to neutral/close grip. Pull to upper chest only. |
| DB incline press | Reduce incline to 15°. If still painful, switch to flat DB press. |

### Foot/Plantar Fascia Pain

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Pain during walk to gym | Shorter stride, slower pace. If >4/10 pain, turn around. Do home mobility only. |
| Pain during gym session | All work is seated/machine-based. Switch standing calf raises to seated. |
| Pain after walk home | Elevate feet 5 min before cooldown. Gentle toe lifts next morning instead of scrunches. |

### Ankle Pinching

| Exercise | Modification |
|----------|--------------|
| Leg press (deep) | Reduce depth. Feet higher on platform. |
| Standing calf raise | Reduce heel drop depth. |

## 14. Nutrition-Training Alignment Notes

Your nutrition is well-structured. At ~2,874 kcal with 305 g protein, you have excellent protein coverage for muscle retention during a deficit.

**Recovery flags to watch for (especially Weeks 3 and 7):**
- Persistent soreness beyond 48 hours
- Weights that felt RPE 7 now feel RPE 9
- Unusual fatigue or poor sleep quality
- **If noticed:** Don't add food as first intervention. Reduce 2–3 sets per session that week, or take an unscheduled deload. Performance dip in a deficit is normal — sustained crash means pull back training stress.

**Protein timing (optimization, not redesign):**
- 30–50 g protein within 1–2 hours post-training and another 30–50 g before your longest sleep period. Given 1–3 AM training, a protein-rich meal/shake post-walk-home is ideal.

**Hydration:**
- At 325 lbs in a deficit: minimum 100–120 oz water daily. Dehydration worsens joint stiffness, reduces performance, and aggravates plantar fascia. Water during walks and training.

---

## 15. Recovery and Off-Day Guidance

**Off days (Days 6–7):**
- "Undo Sitting" micro-routine 2–3 times
- Normal daily walking is fine (no exercise-specific long walks)
- Prioritize sleep — adaptation happens here, doubly important in a deficit
- Light cooldown stretches if stiff

**Sleep:**
- Training at 1–3 AM = non-traditional schedule. Protect your sleep window (7–9 hours). Sleep quality directly impacts strength recovery, fat loss, and joint health.
- Post-workout 90/90 breathing is specifically designed to down-regulate after training. Don't skip it.

**Signs you need an extra rest day:**
- Persistent soreness beyond 48 hours
- Joint pain (not muscle soreness) that lingers
- Resting heart rate elevated
- Genuine motivation crash (not laziness)
- **Action:** Replace next session with off day. Mobility + undo-sitting only. Resume next scheduled day. Don't "make up" missed days.

**Missed-day rules:**
- Miss 1 day: Skip it, continue next scheduled day
- Miss 2 consecutive: Resume with whatever's next in rotation
- Miss 3+: Restart current week from Day 1, 10% load reduction first session

## 16. Tracking Sheet

Copy for each session:

**Session Tracker — Date: _____ | Day: _____**

| Exercise | Prescribed | Tempo | Load | Set 1 | Set 2 | Set 3 | RPE | Notes |

**Finisher:** Type: _________ | Score: _________

**Session notes:** ___________________________________

**RPE Key:**
- 6 = Could do 4 more reps (moderate)
- 7 = Could do 3 more reps (solid effort)
- 8 = Could do 2 more reps (hard — top set target)
- 9 = Could do 1 more rep (very hard — not prescribed this phase)
- 10 = Failure (never prescribed)

## 17. Questions for You (After Week 1)

Report back on these after your first week:

1. How did the walks feel on your feet? Any plantar fascia flare-up?
2. Were working weights genuinely challenging at prescribed RPEs? Which felt too light or heavy?
3. How long did gym sessions actually take?
4. How did finishers feel — hard enough, too easy, or overwhelming?
5. Were you able to complete home mobility routines consistently?
6. How is your sleep post-training at 1–3 AM?
7. Any joint discomfort (not muscle soreness) during or after training?

Your answers let me recalibrate for Week 2 and beyond.
